        have made it their mission to increase the attractivity of vocational education.
        For this purpose, the "world championships of skills" are held every two
        years, in which talented, young people compete with each other. The German
        manifestation of this initiative is
        <Link href="https://www.worldskillsgermany.com" isExternal>
          WorldSkills Germany</Link
        >, which, for example, also hosts national and international
        competitions. In Germany, each skill has a National Training Centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        The National Training Centres by WorldSkills Germany have the task of
        training future members of the German national team and thus
        participants in international competitions, in addition to training
        according to WorldSkills principles for as broad a group of participants
        as possible. They are appointed exclusively only once per skills
        discipline. The appointment is made by the skills mentors (associations,
        companies, institutions) together with WorldSkills Germany.
